# **SOFC Electrode Microstructure Analysis Project**

## **Description**
The project was created to search for the shortest wipes in the microstructures of SOFC fuel cells (solid oxide fuel cells). 
The program uses the Dijkstra and A* algorithms and the Qt library to process images with the .BMP extension. 
Additionally, the Qt library was used to create a simple user interface.
